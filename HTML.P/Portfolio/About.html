        <h2 class="am">About Me.</h2> 
        <p>Chizoba is a student at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka studying Physiotherapy. She is passionate about learning, helping others and working. Like every young girl she dreams to be successful, a woman of impact and value. A woman who other young girls can look up to spiritually, morally and career wise- in the health sector and tech industry in Nigeria. She has just started her journey in Tech, learning Full-Stack Development, courtesy of the Zuri Training in partnership with Ingressive4Good. This is just another project to show how far she has come in learning and how far she is willing to go.</p>

        <h3>Hobbies:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Chizoba finds reading novels and watching a good movie a therapautic sport when she is not learning how to program. It helps calms her nerves. Whenever she is stressed and needs a good escape from reality, reading Lola Shoneyin's <em>"The Secret Life Of Baba Segi's Wives"</em> does that justice. A few of her favourite books are:
                <ul list-style-type="circle">
                    <li>Chimamanda Adichie's <em>"Half of A Yellow Sun"</em></li>

                </ul>
            </li>
